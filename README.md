Project game built by JQuery


This game project will help student or anyone new to jquery. 

It is useful for anyone who wants to undestand the concept of 
	- HTML/DOM manipulation
	- scope
	- set/getting values of HTML/DOM.
	- reloading certain part of a function without reolading the whole page

I recommend you to look at the html before jumping into either jQuery or css

I have tried to give a comment above all the jquery functions and variables which i hope will help you understand the code easly.
